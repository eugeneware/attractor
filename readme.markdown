Attractor is not a framework. Instead, thing of attractor as a minimal amount of
glue necessary to let an ecosystem or autonomous declarative binding modules
flourish, in the [node.js spirit](https://github.com/rvagg/node-levelup) of
[tiny modules](http://voxeljs.com) that
[do one thing well](http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html).

In furtherance of these goals, it's important that attractor modules should be
trivial to reuse outside of attractor itself.
